NanoCrawler-RSSFeedFinder-App is a bit more complex example that
searches for RSS feeds from a given domain. To run the application,
you need to compile and include following CFTA libraries (can be 
found from https://github.com/mlalma/CFTA) in addition to NanoCrawler:
- yarfraw (RSS feed parser)
- CFTA-Lib-RSSFeedFetcher (API for RSS feed parsing)
- CFTA-Lib-WebFetcher (Required by RSS feed parser libs)
- CFTA-Lib-FrontEnd-DataStructures and CFTA-Lib-Util (Utility methods)

The required 3rd party libraries are in /lib.
