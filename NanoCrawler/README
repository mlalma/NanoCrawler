NanoCrawler is a lightweight web crawler library written in Java
and based on crawler4j 3.5 by Yasser Ganjisaffar (see more on
https://code.google.com/p/crawler4j/).

The code has been refactored, some small bugs have been fixed
and some new features have been added such as the support for
URL link prioritization. The web pages are now parsed using
Validator.nu HTML parser (http://about.validator.nu/htmlparser/).

NanoCrawler-Simple-TestApp is a simple test application based
on respective crawler4j's example app that shows NanoCrawler in
action.
